I am Zhourui Ye, a first-year PhD student at Princeton University, co-advised by Professor [Zhuang Liu](https://liuzhuang13.github.io/) and [Danqi Chen](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/). I finished my undergraduate study in Computer Science at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (a.k.a. [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/), directed by [Andrew Chi-Chih Yao](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/yao/)).

My research interest is to develop better understanding into the current ML models and improve their capabilities. I love generally chatting about research or life. Feel free to reach out for any reason!
