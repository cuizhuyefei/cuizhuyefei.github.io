I am Zhourui Ye, a junior-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (a.k.a. [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/), directed by [Andrew Chi-Chih Yao](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/yao/)).

My research interests broadly spread in machine learning. Recently, I am interested in 1) enhancing the intelligence of multi-agent system with techniques of RL and LLM 2) helping humans better communicate with complex ML models 3) understanding phenomenon / mechanisms behind current models to inspire improved techniques. Besides, I also enjoy applying / developing AI techniques to solve real-world challenges with societal significance.
