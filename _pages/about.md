I am Zhourui Ye, a junior-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (a.k.a. [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/), directed by [Andrew Chi-Chih Yao](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/yao/)).

My research interests broadly spread in machine learning. Recently, I am interested in 1) enhancing the intelligence of multi-agent system with techniques of RL and LLM 2) helping humans better communicate with complex ML models 3) understanding phenomenon and mechanisms behind current models to inspire improved techniques. Besides, I also enjoy applying and developing AI techniques to solve real-world challenges with societal significance. 

I am a visiting intern in Professor [Fei Fang](https://feifang.info/)'s group in [CMU](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), also in collaboration with Professor [Geoffrey J. Gordon](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ggordon/) and Professor [Lei Li](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~leili/index.html). Previously, I worked with Professor [Farzan Farnia](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/people/faculty/farzan-farnia/) in [Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), and Professor [Li Yi](https://ericyi.github.io/) in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). I really appreciate the opportunities to work with all of my kind and amazing collaborators.
