I am Zhourui Ye, a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (a.k.a. [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/), directed by [Andrew Chi-Chih Yao](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/yao/)).

My research interests broadly lie in machine learning. Currently, I am deeply fascinated by several topics under the general theme of human-centered AI, including explainability, alignment, and AI safety. I am also interested in the intersection of decision making and foundation models. In my research, I employ rigorous empirical study and principled thinking to understand things deeply.

I was a visiting intern in Professor [Fei Fang](https://feifang.info/)'s group in [CMU](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), also in collaboration with Professor [Geoffrey J. Gordon](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ggordon/) and Professor [Lei Li](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~leili/index.html). Previously, I worked with Professor [Farzan Farnia](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/people/faculty/farzan-farnia/) in [Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), and Professor [Li Yi](https://ericyi.github.io/) in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). I appreciate the opportunities to work with all of my kind and amazing collaborators.

I am applying for PhD in 2025 Fall. I also love generally chatting about research. Feel free to reach out for any reason!
