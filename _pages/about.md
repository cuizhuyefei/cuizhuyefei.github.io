I am Zhourui Ye, a first-year PhD student at Princeton University, where I'm very fortunate to be co-advised by Professor [Zhuang Liu](https://liuzhuang13.github.io/) and [Danqi Chen](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/). I finished my undergraduate study in Computer Science at [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/Yao_Class/About_Yao_Class.htm), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

I am interested in developing methods to understand and improve data-driven computational models. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about research or life.
